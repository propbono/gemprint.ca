We are proud of our [quality control](https://gemprint.ca/blog/16-point-quality-checklist/) process. You can be sure that we always check your files before production and advise if your design can be improved. This kind of feedback from your printer is important so you won't be disappointed by the final result.

We saw many times in our past experience that printers do not put enough input about quality before production. Our business is not all about getting orders and chasing money, quality matters! This makes us different from all others print shops.
